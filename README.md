# Starter Project Files with Webpack

This is a basic file structure and webpack setup to get up and running quickly.

This starter project includes:

1. Webpack Dev Server
1. Handlebars
1. Babel
1. Cleaner or dist folder
1. SASS Compiler

Additionally are 2 npm scripts that run a **dev** or a **production** script.

With _production_ you get all the same features as the _dev_ script, but also has CSS and JavaScript Minification.

All files are output to a _dist_ folder.

When cloning this project, please remember to run `npm install` to install of this projects dependencies.

for _dev_
`npm run dev`

for _production_
`npm run build`

_You must keep the **index.js** and the **index.hbs** files respectively as webpack relies on these files in it's configuration._
